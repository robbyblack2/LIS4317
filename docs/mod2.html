                <strong>Topic:</strong> Motor Vehicle Collisions - Crashes<br>
                <strong>Data Source:</strong> <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/api/views/h9gi-nx95/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD" target="_blank">NYC Open Data - Motor Vehicle Collisions</a><br><br>
                
                <strong>Challenges Faced:</strong><br>
                Some challenges I faced when creating this visualization included the initial configuration of Tableau and importing CSV data. 
                I also had difficulty getting the map to populate and show a gradient based on the concentration of crashes, with the highest concentration displayed as red.
                
                <strong>Visual Grammar Improvements:</strong><br>
                Some additional properties I would include in my graph would be more visual details on the severity of the crashes, as some locations have many crashes but less lethal incidents.
                I would also like to be able to filter the gradient by the type of crash so users can identify specific crash patterns and locations.
