                <p>For this assignment use the built-in mtcars dataset as it offers multilabel variables that all can be used to generate valuable insets on car performance among different models and brands.  My visualization shows trends that heavier and higher horsepower cars get worse miles per gallon. Other trends also show that manual cars tend to be lighter and get better gas millage compared to automatic transmission cars. The Multivariate visualization was effective for representing this data because it revealed patterns that would not be obviously shown if the data was presented in multilabel charts. For contrast I separated data with different colors based on the engine cylinders. I also split each colored mark by shape representing manual and automatic transmission while also sizing the mark based on engine horsepower. For alignment I center titles for a cleaner look and better understandable.  </p>
