I made a scatter plot using the mtcars dataset to compare horsepower and miles per gallon which is filtered by how many cylinders each car has. It clearly shows that cars with more horsepower and more cylinders get worse gas mileage. Using cylinder as a factor clearly shows the diminishing relationship that cylinders have in regard to MPG. The chart shows a clear pattern as horsepower goes up, MPG goes down. This chart does not show any real deviations that are notable following the trend that more cylinders and or horsepower lead to lower miles per gallon. With more data deviations would be present with high performance and or hybrid car data as in the dataset. I did not run into many problems completing this assignment as i have become fluent in ggplot2 library through previous classes taken.  </p>
