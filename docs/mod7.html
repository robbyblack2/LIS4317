                <p>In observing patterns in the charts, the histogram shows a shift in MPG among cars with different cylinder counts. It shows a distinct pattern: more cylinders are associated with lower MPG. This presents a clear negative relationship between cylinder count and MPG.</p>
                <p>I aligned my design with Few and Yau by using color and labels to distinguish metrics. For example, the dashed line in my histogram represents the mean and provides a clear reference.</p>
                <p>I disagree with some of Few’s recommendations. Few emphasizes strictly data‑driven visuals where color and decoration always encode meaning. I think limited, tasteful decoration and color without strict statistical encoding can help users analyze the data. In my opinion, such elements can aid interpretation when used sparingly.</p>
