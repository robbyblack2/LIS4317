                <p>The stacked bar chart uses Time and Average Position to show the part-to-whole relationship in the data. Each bar shows how a time group adds to the total, making it easier to see how the values come together overall. This type of chart is good for highlighting proportions and showing how the data fit together, but a downside is that smaller groups are harder to compare directly, even though the design is effective for showing contribution. </p>
                <p>The regular bar chart focuses only on Average Position across Time, which is good for ranking. By comparing bar lengths side by side, it is easy to identify which intervals are higher or lower and to observe patterns in the dataset. This chart is better for comparing positions directly, but it does not show the proportional relationship to time. I sorted this chart by positional value so it shows the distribution in descending order. </p>
                <p>A strength of the part-to-whole design is that it shows how each group contributes to the overall data, making proportions easy to understand. It highlights the relationship between both Average Position and Time. </p>
